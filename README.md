# Shell Interpreter
The shell command interpreter is the command line interface between the user and the operating system. It is what you will be presented with once you have successfully logged into the system.

The shell allows you to enter commands that you would like to run, and also allows you to manage the jobs once they are running. The shell also enables you to make modifications to your requested commands.

This project is a Shell Interpreter written in C language.
